         * Unlike the 16 KiB default `highWaterMark` for a `stream.Readable`, the stream

         *
         * `options` can include `start` and `end` values to read a range of bytes from
         * the file instead of the entire file. Both `start` and `end` are inclusive and

         * is available. This can prevent the process from exiting and the stream from
         * closing naturally.

         * By default, the stream will emit a `'close'` event after it has been
         * destroyed.  Set the `emitClose` option to `false` to change this behavior.
         *
         * ```js
         * import { open } from 'node:fs/promises';
         *
         * const fd = await open('/dev/input/event0');
         * // Create a stream from some character device.
         * const stream = fd.createReadStream();
         * setTimeout(() => {
         *   stream.close(); // This may not close the stream.
         *   // Artificially marking end-of-stream, as if the underlying resource had
         *   // indicated end-of-file by itself, allows the stream to close.
         *   // This does not cancel pending read operations, and if there is such an
         *   // operation, the process may still not be able to exit successfully
         *   // until it finishes.
         *   stream.push(null);
         *   stream.read(0);
         * }, 100);
         * ```
         *
         * If `autoClose` is false, then the file descriptor won't be closed, even if
         * there's an error. It is the application's responsibility to close it and make
         * sure there's no file descriptor leak. If `autoClose` is set to true (default
         * behavior), on `'error'` or `'end'` the file descriptor will be closed
         * automatically.
